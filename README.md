## Learning CUDA Programming

**Book**: Programming Massively Parallel Processors


This repository contains CUDA Kernels for Basic Math Operations(MatrixMultiplication, Vector Addition etc.) to Deep learning based kernels(Convolutional, Recurrent Etc) written for learning experience from CUDA MODE Lecture series and the book 

Implemented CUDA Kernels:
* Vector Addition
* Matrix Multiplication
* Image Manipulation(RGB Color Image to Grey Scale Image)
